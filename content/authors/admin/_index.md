Hi there! I'm Brady. I take a cognitive neuroscience approach to understand how memory operates, and how we can use that information to enhance remembering in everyday life. 
My main line of work is at the cross-section of memory and semiotics, studying how we remember simple line drawings and everyday symbols.
